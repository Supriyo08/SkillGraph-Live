# 🔓 SkillGraph Live  
### Proof of Skill. Built Live. Built in Public.

![team_dev_email_chat_video_work_wfm_desk_520](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae763de4-7a9d-4d3e-a0b8-73c87a25528b)


## 🚀 Overview

**SkillGraph Live** is an **open-source, cloud-native platform** that explores a new way to verify and represent human skills — through **live execution, real-time evaluation, and dynamic skill graphs**, instead of static resumes or certificates.

The project is designed from day one to:
- Scale to **millions of users**
- Support **real-time workloads**
- Follow **production-grade DevOps practices**
- Be built **collaboratively in public**

This is **not a demo app**.  
This is an **infrastructure-level experiment**.

---

## 🌍 The Problem

Modern platforms rely on:
- Self-reported resumes
- One-time certifications
- Unverified endorsements

These systems fail to represent real ability and skill progression.

---

## 💡 The Idea

SkillGraph Live introduces:
- Live skill demonstrations
- AI + peer-assisted evaluation
- Graph-based skill reputation
- Observable, replayable proof

Skills are executed, measured, and evolved over time.

---

## 🧠 Core Features

- Live Skill Rooms (coding, teaching, debugging)
- AI-assisted evaluation pipelines
- Dynamic Skill Graph (Graph DB)
- Session recording & replay
- Real-time communication (WebSockets / WebRTC)
- Observability-first design

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Frontend
- React.js (Web)
- React Native (Mobile)
- WebSockets, WebRTC

### Backend
- Node.js + NestJS
- Microservices architecture
- REST + gRPC
- Event-driven communication

### Databases
- PostgreSQL (users, auth)
- Redis (real-time state)
- Graph DB (skills)
- Elasticsearch (logs)
- Object storage (recordings)

---

## ☁️ DevOps & Infrastructure

- Docker (containerization)
- Kubernetes (orchestration)
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
- Prometheus (metrics)
- Grafana (dashboards)
- Loki (logs)
- OpenTelemetry (tracing)
- Alertmanager (alerts)
- NGINX / Envoy Ingress

---

## 📈 Scalability Principles

- Stateless services
- Horizontal scaling
- Event-driven workflows
- Autoscaling & graceful degradation

---

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome across:
- Backend & frontend
- DevOps & Kubernetes
- Observability & monitoring
- Documentation

Start with **Good First Issues**.

---

## 🗺️ Roadmap
